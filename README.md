# toythereum

toythereum has the toy solidity compiler and evm.
It's not fully functioned like solc and geth, but it can compile solidity like language and you can run the bytecode in the evm.

## how to use

1. write your solidity code, and put the file into contracts dir
   but it accept only uint256, bool, and string so far.
   Additionally, it doesn't have public, private, view, and etc..
   see example.sol.

2. compile your contract

```
$ sh cmd/compile_contract.sh
```
